# noSnitch
`noSnitch` is an image scraper that runs in your browser:
* it **removes metadata** from images
* it **anonymizes people**: tap on people faces to put a chunky black square on them
* it allows you to **remove details you don't want to share**: just scratch on them with you mouse/finger
* **no installation needed**: just open a browser on the right URL, on any device, even last minute/ in a hurry
* **everything happens locally**: no cloud bullshit, nothing leaves your device
* it **saves cleaned up images**, adding `_nosnitch` to the original file name, so they're easy to find

Use it from here:

or host it wherever you want.

## Warning
Consider this a POC, for theoritical/research purposes. Don't do anything stoopid with it. Stay safe.

## Name
The name is a reference to *Pat The Bunny*'s *A Glorious Shipwreck*. Check it out, it's good acoustic punk.
